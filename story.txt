Atticus and his friends have just embarked on their road trip to watch the total solar eclipse from atop the Continental Divide. The journey to the mountain was arduous and took many hours of driving but group finally arrived at the base of the mountain mere hours before the eclipse was going to take place. Feeling a bit anxious, the group quickly suited up in their mountain climbing gear and began their trek up the mountain. Little did they know what was in store for them on the final leg of this long journey...


The first leg of the climb was suppose to be an easy climb to the first observation point. About 30 minutes into the climb Atticus had noticed that something was off about one of his friends, Jimmy. Jimmy was normally the talkative one in the group. He always found something to relate to and took every chance to share it. However, Jimmy was nothing but silent with a gloomy look on his face. He had made this climb before and for once was scared to share his experience.
