Atticus and his friends have just embarked on their road trip to watch the total solar eclipse from atop the Continental Divide. The journey to the mountain was arduous and took many hours of driving but group finally arrived at the base of the mountain mere hours before the eclipse was going to take place. Feeling a bit anxious, the group quickly suited up in their mountain climbing gear and began their trek up the mountain. Little did they know what was in store for them on the final leg of this long journey...


Not long after they started climbing, the sky became completely dark and the temperature dropped dramatically. Strong wind was blowing all over the mountain and all the trees were blown to the sky. However, Atticus and his friends did not give up. They used the rope they brought with them to tie themselves with each other and continued the climbing.

The next part of the journey they were able to find a moments rest in a cave. The cave provded protection from the wind and place for them to eat snacks. After 10 minutes in the cave they heard sounds coming from the darkness deeper in the cave. They hurried and packed their things as they did not want to meet the creator of those sounds.

As they neared the top, the sky immediately lit up bright red. It was time. The sun would combust. The light grew brighter, raising the temperature significantly and disintegrating all traces of organic life.

Atticus and his friends looked at one another, and they knew it was time. They assumed their true god forms and flew straight into the sun and began to absorb its light energy. As quickly as the event began, it ended and the Earth was gone. The group of gods then began their journey to the next planet with a healthy sun that they could consume.
